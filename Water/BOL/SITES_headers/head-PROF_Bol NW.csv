COMMENTS: Manual lake profiling using sonde technology, in this case a YSI EXO2 Sonde profiler.
For each profile the sonde is lowered by hand throughout the water column pausing the sonde for 5 seconds at each 1 meter intervals. The probe is measuring in 2 second intervals.

At Lake Bolmen the water level requirements aim to not go under the water level 140.9 m a.s.l. for the period 26/4 – 31/8 every year. During the period 1/9 – 20/11 there is a legal right to lower the water level further down to 140.5 m a.s.l. and to hold it on a minimum level of 140.5 m a.s.l. until the 16/3 of the following year, where Statkraft is obliged to fill Bolmen up to a minimum of 140.9 m a.s.l. Since the water levels are a part of the given legal conditions to produce hydro power Statkraft has the right to exploit the levels but never go under. Therefore, the measured profile depth can vary between sampling dates.
